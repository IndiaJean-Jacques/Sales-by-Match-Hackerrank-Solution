# Sales-by-Match-Hackerrank-Solution

I utilised a dictionary to find a solution to the problem where I have different socks of a certain number (which denotes the colour) and I need to find the number of matching pairs of socks in the list passed through the function. 

The dictionary allowed for me to track the number of socks of a certain colour which could come useful for future applications of the code.
